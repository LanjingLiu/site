      abstract: 'Privacy is a complex, context-dependent concept rooted in practice. While many efforts focus on supporting children\'s privacy education, we still lack a clear understanding of how they grasp and apply privacy in managing personal information, along with their expectations for privacy control. To address this, we conducted two co-design workshops with five design sessions, involving children (ages 6-11) to explore how they internalize privacy, act on it, and their expectations for control mechanisms. Our findings reveal three key factors shaping their understanding: autonomy, reflection through practice, and recognizing different privacy contexts. Children seek privacy controls that offer the right to know, strong authentication, and minimal exposure of personal information. They also expect to manage privacy by identifying risks, adapting to contexts, and effectively responding to breaches. We discuss how to better support children\'s privacy and the implications for child-friendly privacy controls and policies.',

      abstract:
        'Adolescent peer relationships, essential for their development, are increasingly mediated by digital technologies. As this trend continues, wearable devices, especially smartwatches tailored for adolescents, is reshaping their socialization. In China, smartwatches like XTC have gained wide popularity, introducing unique features such as "Bump-to-Connect" and exclusive social platforms. Nonetheless, how these devices influence adolescents\' peer experience remains unknown. Addressing this, we interviewed 18 Chinese adolescents (age: 11-16), discovering a smartwatch-mediated social ecosystem. Our findings highlight the ice-breaking role of smartwatches in friendship initiation and their use for secret messaging with local peers. Within the online smartwatch community, peer status is determined by likes and visibility, leading to diverse pursuit activities (i.e., chuguanxi, jiazu, kuolie) and negative social dynamics. We discuss the core affordances of smartwatches and Chinese cultural factors that influence adolescent social behavior, and offer implications for designing future wearables that responsibly and safely support adolescent socialization.',

In this paper, we conducted an interview study with eight families to understand revealing current approaches to privacy education and engagement with ILS for family-based learning. Our findings highlight ILS’s transformative potential in family privacy education, considering existing practices and challenges. We discuss the design opportunities for family-based privacy education in ILS, covering goals, content, engagement, and experience design. These insights contribute to future research on family-based privacy education in ILS.',

        'Observation is common for children to connect with nature, increasing their knowledge and awareness of biodiversity. However, it is challenging for them to make and document their observations due to a lack of observation and drawing skills. Therefore, we designed an interactive drawing tool, Bio Sketchbook, which scaffolds children in systematic observation, observational drawing, and knowledge acquisition. It can recognize plant species and generate contour drawings from children’s photographs, guiding them to observe and draw multi-dimensional plant features with a digital magnifier and in-context biological information. Our in-situ user study with 19 children revealed that Bio Sketchbook provided an engaging experience and effectively supported children in recording and retaining biodiversity information and in balancing observations with screen time. Additionally, Bio Sketchbook intervened in children’s interaction with plants by prompting observational behaviors, encouraging them to directly touch and establish rapport with plants, and arousing their interest and knowledge of plants.',

        'In the 1970s, the youth design education movement originated in the United Kingdom. The team of the Royal College of Art, represented by Bruce Archer, constructed a "British model" based on a technology-led material culture, with the goal of fostering design awareness and the means of practical knowledge learning and action research. After more than 20 years of hard work, the "design and technology" curriculum was formally incorporated into the national curriculum system for primary and secondary schools. This was both a major achievement and a turning point for the movement. ',
