      abstract:
        'Adolescent peer relationships, essential for their development, are increasingly mediated by digital technologies. As this trend continues, wearable devices, especially smartwatches tailored for adolescents, is reshaping their socialization. In China, smartwatches like XTC have gained wide popularity, introducing unique features such as "Bump-to-Connect" and exclusive social platforms. Nonetheless, how these devices influence adolescents\' peer experience remains unknown. Addressing this, we interviewed 18 Chinese adolescents (age: 11-16), discovering a smartwatch-mediated social ecosystem. Our findings highlight the ice-breaking role of smartwatches in friendship initiation and their use for secret messaging with local peers. Within the online smartwatch community, peer status is determined by likes and visibility, leading to diverse pursuit activities (i.e., chuguanxi, jiazu, kuolie) and negative social dynamics. We discuss the core affordances of smartwatches and Chinese cultural factors that influence adolescent social behavior, and offer implications for designing future wearables that responsibly and safely support adolescent socialization.',

        'Observation is common for children to connect with nature, increasing their knowledge and awareness of biodiversity. However, it is challenging for them to make and document their observations due to a lack of observation and drawing skills. Therefore, we designed an interactive drawing tool, Bio Sketchbook, which scaffolds children in systematic observation, observational drawing, and knowledge acquisition. It can recognize plant species and generate contour drawings from children’s photographs, guiding them to observe and draw multi-dimensional plant features with a digital magnifier and in-context biological information. Our in-situ user study with 19 children revealed that Bio Sketchbook provided an engaging experience and effectively supported children in recording and retaining biodiversity information and in balancing observations with screen time. Additionally, Bio Sketchbook intervened in children’s interaction with plants by prompting observational behaviors, encouraging them to directly touch and establish rapport with plants, and arousing their interest and knowledge of plants.',
